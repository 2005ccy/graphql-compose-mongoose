======================
This is a plugin for [graphql-compose](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose), which derives a graphql type from mongoose model.

- [x] write resolve methods (findById, findByIds, findOne, findMany, updateOne, updateMany, removeOne, removeMany, count)
- [ ] realize helper methods for Type construction from [apiProposal]( https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-mongoose/blob/master/src/metaApiProposal.js)
