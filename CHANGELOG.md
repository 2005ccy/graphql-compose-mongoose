* small fixes

## 0.0.6 (July 08, 2016)
* rename `input` argument to `record` for mutations (due `graphql-compose-relay` compatibility).
`input` is a reserved name for mutations' arg in Relay, and may contains not only document/record data (eg. clientMutationId, sort and filter args). So better solution for `graphql-compose-mongoose` do not use this name, cause `graphql-compose-relay` get all args from mongoose resolvers and put them to `input` arg.

* exports flow annotations
